# Nanobyte physical allocators

Some physical memory allocator implementations.

## Build instructions

The project only needs `g++` and `make` for building. To build, simply open a terminal and type

```sh
make
```

## Visualizers

Visualizers are Python scripts that can take the output generated by the `XXXXAllocator.Dump()` method and turn it into an image.

Most of them depend on the `cairo` library (install it with PIP. E.g. `sudo pip3 install cairo`). The Linked List visualizer also depends on the `graphviz` python library, as well as the `graphviz` package from your package manager.

The way I used them was to modify the `demo` project, and set up whatever scenario I want to visualize. Finally I call `Dump()` and pipe the output into the visualizer. For example:

```sh
run-demo.sh | python ./bitmap_visualize.py
```

Obviously, you must not print anything else to the standard output (use stderr if you really have to).

## Project structure

* `src/phallocators` - this is a static library where the physical allocators are actually implemented
* `src/demo` - a demo application showing how to use the allocators
* `src/tests` - some unit tests for verifying that the physical allocators work properly
* `visualizers` - a bunch of python scripts for creating pretty pictures showing the state of the allocators
